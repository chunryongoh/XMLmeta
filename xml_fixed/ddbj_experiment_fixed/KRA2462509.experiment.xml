				<LIBRARY_CONSTRUCTION_PROTOCOL>First, single-cell suspensions were prepared for 10x Genomics 3u0026#39; v3.1 droplet-based sequencing, targeting recovery of ~8,000 cells (or nuclei); cell (or nucleus) concentration was determined using the Countess II Automated Cell Counter (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The pooled single-cell cDNA library was prepared following the manufactureru0026#39;s protocol (#CG000204 Rev B, 10x Genomics) with a few modifications. First, we increased the incubation time for reverse transcription reaction (GEM-RT reaction) from 45 minutes to 75 minutes to allow the completion of reverse transcription reactions for longer mRNA transcripts. Additionally, for the initial PCR amplification of the cDNA and all subsequent re-amplifications of the resulting cDNA library, the PCR elongation time was extended from 1 minute to 3 minutes to allow amplification of longer cDNA molecules (up to 6 kbp). Next, the short-read scRNA-seq library was prepared using up to half of the amplified cDNA library, strictly following the manufactureru0026#39;s instructions (#CG000204 Rev B, 10x Genomics). The short-read scRNA-seq library was sequenced on a HiSeq platform (Illumina) (28 andu0026thinsp;91 bases for read1 and read2, respectively), targeting 200M reads per sample (u0026gt; 20,000 reads per cell).</LIBRARY_CONSTRUCTION_PROTOCOL>

The pooled single-cell cDNA library was prepared following the manufactureru0026#39;s protocol (#CG000204 Rev B, 10x Genomics) with a few modifications.

Additionally, for the initial PCR amplification of the cDNA and all subsequent re-amplifications of the resulting cDNA library, the PCR elongation time was extended from 1 minute to 3 minutes to allow amplification of longer cDNA molecules (up to 6 kbp). Next, the short-read scRNA-seq library was prepared using up to half of the amplified cDNA library, strictly following the manufactureru0026#39;s instructions (#CG000204 Rev B, 10x Genomics). The short-read scRNA-seq library was sequenced on a HiSeq platform (Illumina) (28 andu0026thinsp;91 bases for read1 and read2, respectively), targeting 200M reads per sample (u0026gt; 20,000 reads per cell).</LIBRARY_CONSTRUCTION_PROTOCOL>

				<LIBRARY_CONSTRUCTION_PROTOCOL>First, single-cell suspensions were prepared for 10x Genomics 3u0026#39; v3.1 droplet-based sequencing, targeting recovery of ~8,000 cells (or nuclei); cell (or nucleus) concentration was determined using the Countess II Automated Cell Counter (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The pooled single-cell cDNA library was prepared following the manufactureru0026#39;s protocol (#CG000204 Rev B, 10x Genomics) with a few modifications. First, we increased the incubation time for reverse transcription reaction (GEM-RT reaction) from 45 minutes to 75 minutes to allow the completion of reverse transcription reactions for longer mRNA transcripts. Additionally, for the initial PCR amplification of the cDNA and all subsequent re-amplifications of the resulting cDNA library, the PCR elongation time was extended from 1 minute to 3 minutes to allow amplification of longer cDNA molecules (up to 6 kbp). Next, the short-read scRNA-seq library was prepared using up to half of the amplified cDNA library, strictly following the manufactureru0026#39;s instructions (#CG000204 Rev B, 10x Genomics). The short-read scRNA-seq library was sequenced on a HiSeq platform (Illumina) (28 andu0026thinsp;91 bases for read1 and read2, respectively), targeting 200M reads per sample (u0026gt; 20,000 reads per cell).</LIBRARY_CONSTRUCTION_PROTOCOL>
