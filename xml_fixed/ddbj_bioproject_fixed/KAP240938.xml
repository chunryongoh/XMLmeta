					<Title>Saturated Mutagenesis of Hemagglutinin of Influenza A virus H1N1 (Pandemic strain)</Title>
					<Description>Purpose To evaluate the characteristics of Influenza A virus (H1N1) mutants, a saturated mutagenesis libraries for the hemagglutinin (HA) sequence were created to conduct infection experiments in vitro. Scheme Using the HA sequence of the pdm09 strain A/California/07/2009 (CA09) as a template, a saturated mutated plasmid libraries were generated for the receptor-binding domain encompassing amino acids 101-250. The HA plasmid libraries were transfected into HEK293T cells along with the NA from CA09 and the PB2, PB1, PA, NP, M, and NS sequences from A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (PR8) to produce P0 virus. The P0 virus was used to infect the MDCK cell line at MOI of less than 0.01 to produce the P1 virus. Subsequently, the P1 virus was used to infect the A549 cell line at MOI of less than 0.01 to generate the P2 virus.</Description>
