					<Title>Effects of calorie restriction in a high-dose folic acid-induced renal fibrosis model.</Title>
					<Description>Dietary restriction is known to be effective in controlling various chronic conditions. In this study, mouse experiments were conducted to confirm the effects of dietary restriction in a high-dose folic acid-induced renal fibrosis model. Mice were subjected to high-dose folic acid to induce renal fibrosis, with one group under dietary restriction and another on a regular diet. Changes in fibrosis-related, inflammatory, and metabolic factors were observed in the kidneys. Through this study, we were able to determine the impact of dietary restriction in an environment conducive to renal disease induction.</Description>
