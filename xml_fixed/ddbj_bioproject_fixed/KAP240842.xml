					<Title>Emergence of CpG-cluster blanket methylation in aged tissues</Title>
					<Description>Age-related gain of DNA methylation, or hypermethylation, commonly occurs in gene promoters, particularly at promoter-associated CpG islands (CGIs), potentially altering the transcriptional activity of associated genes (8,15). There are two potential mechanisms to explain the age-related gain of DNA methylation in CGIs. The first is the de novo methylation of singleton CpGs in tissue cells, which occurs randomly. The second is the emergence of highly methylated alleles from a subset of cells with different characteristics, such as those that undergo fast senescence compared to the rest of the cell population. To distinguish between the two mechanisms and to provide a comprehensive description of age-related alterations in DNA methylation patterns at spatially clustered CpG sites in diverse aged mouse tissues, we employed a DNA methylation phasing, a process of identifying the positional relationship between methylated and unmethylated CpGs along the DNA molecule, using methylomes generated through reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS). We hope that this study will contribute to our understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms that underpin the aging process and age-related diseases, thereby facilitating the development of more effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.</Description>
