					<Title>Production of Non-GM F1 hybrid rice and Chinese cabbage using CRISPR/Cas9 system</Title>
					<Description>Through previous research, a number of new GMS-based genes that cause male sterility were discovered and their characteristics were identified. Using the CRISPR/Cas9 system, GM male sterility lines were produced with genetic mutations in these male sterility genes. We developed an innovative source technology to produce hybrids by crossing the obtained male-sterile maternal parent with the wild-type paternal parent, and to separate and select male-sterile maintenance parent seeds and non-GM hybrid seeds that can be immediately used in agricultural fields through fluorescence screening of the obtained seeds. (3 PCT patent applications). We plan to simultaneously conduct performance improvement research and prototype production based on the developed original technology. The target crops are rice, which is a fertile food crop, and Chinese cabbage, which is an F1 hybrid variety used in the market. We aim to finally establish and commercialize a creative NBT-based non-GM rice and cabbage hybrid (F1 hybrid) production technology using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. The goal is to prepare biorisk reports and enter evaluation screening by creating metadata and building a DB for research data on produced crops.</Description>
